      <section >

       <p>The landscape of urban and regional geographic research is evolving as
a result of the vast integration of digital technologies into nearly
every aspect of human activity. The streams of data resulting from
social media, open government initiatives, the pervasive presence of
sensors, and many other sources collectively form what has now been
termed Big Data. Of special interest to geographers is that these data
tend to be geo-referenced, which provides a potentially useful data
source for studying cities and regions. By connecting this data
availability with computational advances that enable processing and
modeling at a very low cost, the idea of building a science around
spatial big data becomes attainable and almost imperative. The derived
question from the current situation has to do with the value added of
the growing data wealth in spatial sciences. What can we learn about
cities and regions by employing Big Data and other non-traditional
data sources in urban and regional modeling?  In order to answer this
question we call for papers focusing on the following points:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Empirical applications of Big Data in quantitative geography</li>
        <li>Studies bridging the gap between traditional sources of (small) data
        (e.g., censuses) and new sources of (big) data</li>
        <li>Applications and experiences in which Big Data is used to inform
        policy decisions</li>
        <li>Studies that quantitatively explore the strengths and weaknesses
        of Big Data</li>
    </ul>
