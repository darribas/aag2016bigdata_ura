      <p>The recent phenomenon of "Big Data", by which an increasing number of
      human activities are recorded in one way or another in digital form, is
      producing an unprecedented amount of data of different shape, structure
      and quality, much of which are georeferenced. At the same time,
      technology has advanced to a point where we have enough computational
      power not only to produce large amounts of data, but also to analyze and
      extract valuable information from them. This pairing of larger datasets
      and increasing computing power is transforming many aspects of the
      world, from businesses to government. Science has not been foreign to
      these developments, and many fields, from genomics to physics to
      biology, are being substantially redefined as a result of it.</p>

      <p>The social sciences in general, and geography in particular, however
      have only marginally engaged with this new reality. Although some
      discussions are emerging about the broad implications of this shift, the
      amount of applied studies that use these kinds of datasets to answer
      long-standing questions in urban and regional geography and related
      spatial disciplines is still limited. In order to expand the discussion
      and engagement with these new sources of data among geographers, we are
      proposing a series of special sessions revolving around the following
      general topics:</p>

      <p></p>

      <ul>
          <li>Empirical applications of Big Data in quantitative geography and regional science</li>
          <li>Applications and experiences in which Big Data is used to inform  policy decisions</li>
          <li>Studies that quantitatively explore the strengths and weaknesses of Big Data</li>
          <li>Studies bridging the gap between traditional sources of (small) data (e.g. censuses) and new sources of (big) data</li>
      </ul>

</ul>
      </p>
